It follows an opinionated **convention over configuration** approach, providing a solid foundation so that you can focus on writing your code.\r\n\r\nIt is currently build around [React](http://reactjs.com/), a but the idea is to modularize it so that it supports other types of projects.\r\n\r\nRight off of the bat you get:\r\n\r\n- JavaScript 2015 language support;\r\n- Automated testing;\r\n- Linting via [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com/);\r\n- Build and development infrastructure;\r\n- Live-reload via \"hot module replacement\".\r\n\r\nIn simpler terms, it is **your last devDependency**!\r\n\r\n- A local dependency, not another global tool. It should be just `node` and `npm`;\r\n- No more generators;\r\n- No more boiletplate projects;\r\n- No more starter kits.\r\n\r\nIt acts as a frontend for [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) and [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) so you don't have to worry about them.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Still early in development, and might miss something that you want.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nCreate a new NPM project:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm init -y .\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall **sagui** in the project:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install --save-dev sagui\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the install is completed, Sagui **bootstraps** its basic infrastructure:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ tree\r\n.\r\n├── node_modules\r\n│   └── sagui\r\n├── package.json\r\n└── src\r\n    ├── index.html\r\n    ├── index.js\r\n    ├── index.scss\r\n    └── index.spec.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart developing **using common NPM run scripts**:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the tests!\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm test\r\n```\r\n\r\nSagui manages the [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) scripts for you, creating additional tasks such as:\r\n\r\n- `npm run sagui:test`\r\n- `npm run sagui:test-watch`\r\n- `npm run sagui:develop`\r\n- `npm run sagui:build`\r\n- `npm run sagui:dist`\r\n\r\nThen you can start writing your code inside the `src/` folder.\r\n\r\n## Pages\r\n\r\nBy default, sagui will build and serve a single page for your entire application. This is your `src/index.js` and `src/index.html` files.\r\n\r\nTo change it and add more pages, you can add a custom configuration in the `package.json` file:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"sagui\": {\r\n    \"pages\": [\"index\", \"demo\"]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd add aditional `src/demo.js` and `src/demo.html` files.\r\n\r\n## Under the hood\r\n\r\nSagui is made possible by a bunch of pretty awesome projects:\r\n\r\n- [Babel](http://babeljs.io/);\r\n- [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/);\r\n- [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/);\r\n- [ESlint](http://eslint.org/);\r\n- [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com/);\r\n- [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/);\r\n- [React transform](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform).\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nTo develop the tool locally, we will need to resort to a combination of a global [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) and local links in projects.\r\n\r\nYou can start by linking Sagui globally. While at its folder:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nSAGUI_LINK=true npm link\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe environment variable is to inform Sagui that it is working in a \"linked environment\".\r\n\r\nThen, **at the project you intend to use Sagui**, link it locally:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm link sagui\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, the project is set to use your development copy of Sagui. Unfortunately, you will need to run any command in the project providing the environment variable `SAGUI_LINK`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nSAGUI_LINK=true npm start\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nIt is an idea I had in mind for a while, and after seeing a similar approach internally at [Klarna](https://github.com/klarna) (in the form of a global tool), I've got inspired to build a simpler (and locally installed) version of my own.\r\n\r\nThe internals were based on:\r\n\r\n- [gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate)\r\n- [pirelenito/generator-react-webpack-component](https://github.com/pirelenito/generator-react-webpack-component)\r\n\r\n## Version 1.x.x\r\n\r\nThe first version of this project was supposed to be a project bootstrap, you can still check its original implementation at the [1.x.x branch](https://github.com/pirelenito/sagui/tree/1.x.x).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
